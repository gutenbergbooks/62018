<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Jacob Fowler is an unknown author whose work
has never before been heralded beyond the private
circles of his friends, relatives, and descendants. The
editor of his Journal has therefore a man as well as a
book to introduce to the public. Being responsible
for the appearance of the latter in print, he will presently
say something on that score. But first let us
hear from Colonel R. T. Durrett, of Louisville, Ky.,
the owner of the manuscript now published, who will
speak for its author:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Louisville, Ky.</span>, <i>Dec. 4, 1897</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dr. Elliott Coues</span>, <i>Washington, D. C.</i></p>

<p>I have your letter, My Dear Doctor, in which you
request me to tell what I may know about the Journal
you found among my manuscripts when you were my
guest last year, and which you have determined to
include in your admirable series of Western Americana.
I am sorry to have to say that I do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
much of this manuscript or its author. The little I
know, however, will be cheerfully contributed to an
undertaking which is to place a Kentucky manuscript
from my collection among the publications which,
under your editorship, have added so much to our
literature of discovery, exploration, and adventure.</p>

<p>The author of this Journal is Major Jacob Fowler.
His name is not attached to the Journal, and
does not appear on any of its pages in such a way
as to indicate authorship. Yet it is well understood
among his numerous descendants now living in Kentucky
and other States that he is the author. I obtained
the manuscript some years ago from Mrs. Ida
Symmes Coates, daughter of the late Americus
Symmes, now residing at her country seat near Louisville.
Mrs. Coates is a great-granddaughter, on the
maternal side, of Jacob Fowler. The manuscript descended
to her in a direct line from her mother,
Frances Scott, who was a granddaughter of Jacob
Fowler, and who had obtained it in the same way
from her mother, Abigail Fowler, the only daughter
of Jacob Fowler. The manuscript has thus come
down to us in a direct line, and is the unquestionable
work of Major Jacob Fowler.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Coates gave me this manuscript she
remarked that although her great-grandsire was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
very well educated man, he wrote a very bad hand,
and that I might be puzzled now and then in getting
at his meaning. I found this to be true, and would
not like to say that I succeeded in interpreting all of
his modern hieroglyphics. When I placed the manuscript
in your hands I felt sure that Lewis and Clark,
Pike, and Henry and Thompson, as well as other
explorers, had made you so familiar with the country
gone over by Major Fowler, that you could with
comparative ease master its chirographic difficulties.
In this I was right; but I do remember how, with
your constantly replenished pipe, you sat in my
library, and smoked and puzzled over this manuscript.
A distinguished host once assured his guest that the
more raw turnips he ate, the more water he would
drink, and that the more water he drank, the more
turnips he would eat. With a touch of similarity,
you smoked and read, and read and smoked, with
manifest indications of successful or unsuccessful interpretations
of the text, as your puffs were rapid or
slow. It might be hard to say whether you smoked
most or read most, but you finally mastered the
manuscript; and whether you did so by smoking out
the uninterpretable hieroglyphics, or got rid of them
by other means, does not matter. While a cloud of
smoke may not seem to be the best means of clearing
up the obscurity of a manuscript, it is the known result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
here considered, if not the philosophy of its
action.</p>

<p>Pioneers by the name of Fowler were early in
Kentucky, and some of them were the owners of large
bodies of land. In 1783, Alexander Fowler entered
10,000 acres on the Little Kentucky river; and in
1784, John Fowler, who was the first member of Congress
from Ashland District, located 1536 acres on
Brush creek and on the dividing ridge between Pitman’s
creek and Robertson’s run. I do not know
whether Jacob Fowler was of the family of these
Fowlers, but he was certainly akin to them in so far
as the love and ownership of lands were concerned.
Besides other possessions, he owned 2000 acres of the
site of the present city of Covington, Kenton Co., Ky.
He was one of the pioneers of what afterward became
the county of Kenton, before the city of Covington
was incorporated. A census of the male inhabitants
of this locality shows him to have been residing here
in 1810, with his sons Edward and Benjamin. Had
he been permitted to retain these Covington lands, he
might have become a multi-millionaire. His kind
heart, however, led him to become the indorser of
those who made a clean sweep of his fine estate. A
large double brick dwelling house, handsomely furnished,
in the midst of ample grounds, planted with
trees and shrubbery, flowers and blue-grass, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
with his lands to pay the debts of others. Had he
written his name as indorser as illegibly as he wrote
the names of others in his Journal, there might have
been some ground for what lawyers call the plea
of <i lang="la">non est factum</i>, to clear him of liability. But such
was not the case, and his security for others swept
away his large estate.</p>

<p>Major Fowler was born in New York, in 1765, and
came to Kentucky in early life, a fine specimen of
physical manhood, fully equipped for the office and
duties of a surveyor. His surveying instruments
were the best of their day, and elicited no little envy
from those who used the common Jacob’s staff and
compass, and chain of the times. He had the reputation
of being an accomplished surveyor, and did much
in this line for the United States government. His
surveying extended to the great plains and mountains
of the far West, before civilization had reached these
distant wilds. He was there when wild animals and
wilder savages were the only tenants of the wilderness.</p>

<p>Major Fowler married the widow Esther Sanders,
<i lang="fr">née</i> de Vie, of Newport, Ky. She was of French
descent, and a lady of great beauty and accomplishments.
She made his home one of happiness and
hospitality. She sometimes accompanied him on his
surveying expeditions and bore domestic charms to
the tent in which they lived, as she did to the palatial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
mansion at home. She was a woman of fine business
capacity, who, when her husband was not at home,
attended to his affairs, and especially to his farm in
the suburbs of Covington. Here fine stock and
abundant crops owed much to her constant care and
supervision. The grapes that grew on the place were
made into wine and the apples into cider, in accordance
with the knowledge she had inherited from her
French ancestors. Her great-grandchildren of to-day
tell of the life of the camp, when she was with her
husband in his surveying expeditions. The tent floor
was nicely carpeted; a comfortable bed invited repose
after the toil of the day; dainty china, bright cut
glass, and shining silverware, handsome enough to
be preserved as family heirlooms by their descendants,
were used on the camp table. It was something of
Parisian life in the dreary wilderness.</p>

<p>Major Fowler died in Covington in the year 1850.
His life as a surveyor and explorer in the West subjected
him to many hardships, but a constitution
naturally vigorous was preserved with care until he
reached his eighty-sixth year. He has numerous descendants
in Kentucky, Ohio, and other States, some
of whom occupy high social positions. Mrs. Coates,
to whom I am indebted for this manuscript Journal,
is, in the paternal line, the granddaughter of Captain
John Cleve Symmes, author of the “Theory of Concentric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Spheres,” 12mo. Cincinnati, 1826, and great-grandniece
of Hon. John Cleve Symmes, a member
of Congress from New Jersey, who purchased of the
United States government that vast body of land
in the State of Ohio, lying on the north bank of the
Ohio river between the two Miamis. With the
knowledge and consent of her father, the late
Americus Symmes, she gave me the manuscript in
the belief that I would make some good use of it.
After thinking for a time that I would place it among
the Filson Club Publications, I changed my mind and
turned it over to you to be published. I think this
is the best use I could have made of the manuscript,
and I shall now wait with impatience until I see your
work published in the best style of Francis P. Harper,
and read your ample notes and comments, which I
doubt not will be after the inimitable manner of your
Lewis and Clark, your Pike, and your Henry and
Thompson.</p>

<p class="center">Truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">R. T. Durrett</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The MS. which I received from Colonel Durrett is
entitled: “memorandom of the voige by land from
fort Smith to the Rockey mountains”—and is the
most like those mountains of any I have ever undertaken
to overcome. My eminent friend does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
exaggerate the difficulty of deciphering the characters
which he aptly styles “hieroglyphics,” and which
have hitherto kept this writing a sealed book. The
text begins verso of the title, and ostensibly runs pp.
1-264, but pagination is once skipped and twice
duplicated. The folios may be called of square note-paper
size, nearly that of a small quarto book—8 × 6½
inches for pp. 1-180, but larger, nearly 9 × 7,
for the rest. The ragged edges make exact measurements
impracticable, Father Time’s paper-mill having
turned out a deckel-edged product, so fashionable
nowadays. The sheets, of four pages or two folios
each, are gathered in 16-page packets, the outsides of
which are now much soiled—indeed, the rough, unruled
surfaces are all darkened with the dust of three-quarters
of a century, and the ink is faded to match
the same subdued monotone, except in places where
it recedes to the vanishing point. The writing is
upon both sides of the paper; and the whole effect,
if it could be facsimiled, would be a bibliomaniac’s
dream of delight.</p>

<p>At first sight, this manuscript appears illegible; no
one can read it off-hand. Nevertheless, this writing
proves readable upon sufficient study of the alphabetic
characters which Fowler invented to suit himself,
like that classic old Theban Cadmus, or his
modern imitator, Cherokee Sequoiah. I managed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
master it under the agreeable circumstances of my
visit to Louisville, to which my host on that occasion
has so pleasantly alluded in the letter printed above;
and after that my secretary also proved herself equal
to the task when she took the matter in hand to copy
for the press. There are hardly a dozen words in
which doubt attaches to a single letter, and probably
not half as many have proven altogether illegible.</p>

<p>Fowler wrote a large sprawling hand, as may be
judged by the fact that only 174 of these small open
pages are required to print his 264 folios, with my
176 notes. He commonly conforms to the requirements
of dotted <i>i</i> and crossed <i>t</i>, but otherwise strikes
out for himself in the formation of letters. His most
original invention is an <i>r</i> which would puzzle Œdipus,
as it is always a careful <i>n</i>; most of his short-stroke characters
look alike in their resemblance to bends of the
Arkansaw river on a map, and his long strokes seem
as if they had been struck by lightning. The incessant
capitals are flourished elaborately, and not confined to
initial letters. Fowler is also fond of capping little
words, as if he thought they needed such help to hold
up their heads with big ones, and equally apt to begin
proper names, sentences, and paragraphs with lower-case
letters. This style of composition appears on
the printed page, which faithfully imitates every
peculiarity of the original which can be set with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
ordinary font of type. The syntax is the sort which
has been happily called “dash dialect”—Fowler has
no other punctuation than the dash, excepting a
sporadic period here and there, usually misplaced, and
an occasional stab at the paper which is neither one
thing nor another, and may therefore be overlooked.
His spelling speaks so well for itself in print that little
need be said on that score. Its entire originality, its
effusive spontaneity, its infinite variety, will charm
the reader while it puzzles him, and make the
modern manufacturer of Dialect despair of his most
ingenious craft. Aside from sheer slips of the pen,
by which Fowler often misses letters, as in writing
“campe,” “caped,” “capped,” or “capted” for
<i>camped</i>, there is a particular point to which I may call
attention as the most characteristic—in fact, the
diagnostic—feature
of his composition. It is that habitual
omission of final <i>y</i> which makes the definite article
do duty for the third personal pronoun nominative;
and when this is followed by a misspelled verb simulating
a noun, some curious locutions result. Thus,
“the Road” stands for <i>they rode</i>; “the Ware,” for
<i>they were</i>; “the Cold,” for <i>they could</i>; “the Head,”
for <i>they had</i>; “the Maid,” for <i>they made</i>—and so on,
to the end of the book.</p>

<p>But it is needless to pursue this alluring theme; the
reader may turn to the text which follows this feeble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
preface so strenuously, and see for himself with what
a <i lang="fr">tour de force</i> our ingenious author managed to evade
what we now call good grammar. I have found
more than one reason for transferring this curious
copy to type with the utmost verbality, literality, and
punctuality of which the compositor is capable. In
the first place, it tickled my fancy so that I wished
others to enjoy the same sensation—for is it not said
that our joys are doubled by sharing them, as our
sorrows are halved by the same process? Again, to
prolong these pleasantries, I may say that I thought
this would be a good way to show that awesome
deference which I ought to feel for certain captious
critics of former works with which my name is associated,
whose green-eyed strabismus has seen me in
the light of entirely too good an editor—that is to say,
who have complimented me by their censure for making
my authors too intelligible, too attractive, and
altogether too readable, by the way I dressed them for
the press.</p>

<p>So I determined to submit the pure text of Fowler’s
Journal to the discernment of competent critics of
literary wares, as well as to the lack of that quality in
fussy fault-finders, and let everybody see how some
manuscript looks when it is printed just as it is written.
I do not vaunt this specimen as unique in any
respect except the handwriting, a sample of which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
reproduced. The article is much like others of Fowler’s
times and circumstances; it is only a little off the
average syntax and orthography of that period, with
a few more capitals and dashes than were then usual.
I know authors of our own day whose copy would
turn out a good deal like Fowler’s if the printer did
not fix it up for them. They are mostly the ones
who damn instead of blessing the artists of the art
preservative of arts. Few women, for example, can
spell quite like the dictionaries; fewer still can
punctuate properly; and fewest of all persons of
either sex in the world are those authors, even among
professional literarians, who would like or could
afford to see themselves set up in print exactly as they
write themselves down. There is said to be a day
coming when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed,
the wicked shall tremble, and they shall say to
the mountains, “fall on us”—or words to that effect.
I cite the passage from early memory, not having the
author in hand, and have not verified the quotation;
but I will risk anything of that sort, provided the day
never comes when the secrets of the printing office
shall be revealed. I am at peace with my God, my
neighbor, and myself; but—I am an author.</p>

<p>If we turn from the form to the substance of
Fowler’s Journal, and ask to see the bill of lading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
curious to know what useful or valuable information
is contained in so singular a vehicle of conveyance, it
may be confidently said that this “prairie schooner”
is well freighted for a “voige” on the highway of
Americana; for the cargo is a novel and notable contribution
to our knowledge of early commercial venture
and pioneering adventure in the Great West. It
is simply a story of the trader and trapper, unsupported
by the soldier, unimpeded by the priest, and in
no danger from the politician. The scene is set in
the wilderness; the time is when pack-animals are
driven across the stage, before the first wheels rolled
over the plains from the States to Santa Fé; and the
actors have very real parts to perform.</p>

<p>From the respective dates of Pursley, of Lalande,
and of Pike, whose several travels were among the
first if not the earliest overland from the United
States to the Spanish settlements, on the part of
American citizens—from the opening years of the
century to the 1821-22 of Fowler—various parties
were on the Arkansaw in what are now Kansas and
Colorado. But the records of where they went or
what they did? That is the question. Ezekiel Williams,
James Workman, Samuel Spencer, sole and
shadowy survivors of Coyner’s “Lost Trappers,” are
only uneasy spirits flitting from the Missouri to
Mexico and California in an apocryphal book, never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
materializing out of fable-land into historical environment.
Wherever other American trappers or traders
may have gone on the Arkansaw or even the Rio
Grande in those days, and whatever they may have
done, Fowler was first to forge another sound link in
the chain which already reached from Pike to Long.
The latter’s justly celebrated expedition came down
the Arkansaw and the Canadian in 1820. Pike
ascended the main river from its great bend to its
sources in 1806, the same year that his lieutenant,
Wilkinson, descended this stream from the point
where he parted from his captain. For the lower
reaches of the river we have Thomas Nuttall’s Journal
of Travels into the Arkansa Territory, during the
year 1819, and various other accounts. But I know
of no record, earlier in date than Fowler’s, of continuous
ascent of the river from Fort Smith to the present
position of Pueblo in Colorado. He meandered the
whole course of the Arkansaw between the points
named, except his cut-off of a small portion by the
Verdigris trail. One of his men, Lewis Dawson, who
was killed by a grizzly bear at the mouth of the Purgatory—and
who, let us hope, left that place for
happier hunting-grounds—may not have been the
first white American buried in Colorado soil; but the
record of a prior funeral would be far to seek.
Whose was the first habitable and inhabited house on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
the spot where Pueblo now stands? Fowler’s, probably;
for Pike’s stockade was hardly a house, and Jim
Beckwourth came twenty years after Fowler. The
Taos Trail from Santa Fé through the Sangre de
Cristo Pass to the Arkansaw at Pueblo was well
known to the Spaniards when Fowler’s party traversed
it in the opposite direction; but we have no American
itinerary of that passage at an earlier date than his.
When Fowler ascended the Rio Grande to Hot
Spring creek in the San Juan range, he followed a
Spanish road; but never before had an American expedition
been so near the sources of that great river
Del Norte, and not till many years afterward did any
such prolong Fowler’s traces upward. The greater
part of Fowler’s homeward journey from Taos to
Fort Osage will doubtless prove as novel to his
readers as it was unexpected by his editor. South of
the Arkansaw, his trail was neither by the way he had
gone before, nor by either of those roads which were
soon be established and become well known; for
he came neither by the Cimarron nor the Raton route,
but took a straighter course than either, between the
two, over Chico Rico Mesa and thence along Two
Butte creek to the Arkansaw on the Kansan-Coloradan
border. Again, when Fowler left the Arkansaw
to strike across Kansas, he did not take up the
direct route which caravans were about to blaze as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
the Santa Fé Trail from Missouri through Council
Grove to Great Bend; but went a roundabout way,
looping far south to heads of the Whitewater and
Verdigris rivers before he crossed the Neosho to
make for the Missouri below the mouth of the Kansas.</p>

<p>This bare outline of the way Fowler went in twice
crossing the Plains, to and from the Rocky mountains,
suffices to show that, taken as a whole, it was
not only the first but also the last such itinerary
of which we have any knowledge; for if this route has
since been retraversed in its entirety, time has obliterated
all sign of such an adventure.</p>

<p>Another point is to be scored in connection with
Fowler’s unique performance. The date is a critical
one in the history of the whole subject. That elusive
“Red river” which Pike sought in vain in 1806 was
only the year before Fowler found by Long to be the
Canadian fork of the Arkansaw, instead of that separate
tributary of the Mississippi which Long imagined
he was descending till he reached its confluence with
the same stream which the other detachment of his
party followed down. Just at the time when Long
had finished his exploration, and Fowler was leading
his people home from their wide wandering, the Santa
Fé trade was taking definite shape. Like every
other such enterprise, this one went through its tentative
stages of hesitancy and disconcert, before its final<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
organization as a regular industry; and if any year
can be named as that of complete equipment for the
business, it is that of 1822. Fowler was thus a factor
in the beginnings of a commerce which grew by what
it fed upon to the immense proportions it had acquired
when it was checked by the troubles of 1846.</p>

<p>Whatever be deemed the merit or demerit of
Fowler’s work as a whole, viewed in the light of a
contribution to the history of Western adventure in
connection with the fur trade, I can attest the coherency
and consequence of the narrative now before us.
The author tells a plain, straightforward story, and
never fails to make it intelligible. He never loses the
thread of his discourse, never tangles it into an irrelevant
skein, and holds himself well in hand through all
the asperities he experienced. He is a reasonable
sort of a writer, if not a very ready one. I have had
little trouble in trailing him from start to finish, for
all that compass-points uncorrected for magnetic
variation, and distances chained only in the sensations
of a tired traveler, are not among the “constants
of nature”—especially in the mountains; and
I am satisfied that his route is laid down correctly in
my notes. The sign is a little dim here and there, in
some of the cross-country laps, but we never lose it.
Fowler had the good eye for topography to be expected
of a professional surveyor, and I only wish that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
some other persons whose peregrinations I have had
occasion to follow had exercised powers of observation
equal to those which Fowler displayed under
arduous exigencies of trade and travel.</p>

<p>Thus far by way of introducing to the public the
hitherto unknown author of a new contribution to
Americana, which I hope may find that favor which
I believe it deserves.</p>

<p>The task of copying Fowler’s Journal <i>v. l. p.</i> was
intrusted to an expert, Mrs. Mary B. Anderson, to
whom acknowledgments are due for the result. The
copy was made in my absence from home last summer,
during which the lady was left entirely to her
own resources in making out the manuscript; and
subsequent critical comparison of the transcription
with the original served mainly to show its beauty as
well as accuracy. The Index is also her careful
handiwork.</p>

Camped in a grove of Bushes and timber about two
miles up it from the River We maid Eleven miles
West this day—We Stoped Heare about one oclock
and Sent back for one Hors that Was not able to keep

Some Ware Hunting and others Cooking
Some Picking grapes a gun Was fyered off and the
Cry of a White Bare<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Was Raised We Ware all
armed in an Instent and Each man Run His own Cors
to look for the desperet anemel—the Brush in Which
We Camped Contained from 10 to 20 acors Into
Which the Bare Head [bear had] Run for Shelter
find[ing] Him Self Surrounded on all Sides—threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
this Conl glann With four others atemted to Run
But the Bare being In their Way and lay Close in the
brush undiscovered till the Ware With in a few feet
of it—When it Sprung up and Caught Lewis doson
and Pulled Him down In an Instent Conl glanns
gun mised fyer or He Wold Have Releved the man
But a large Slut Which belongs to the Party atacted
the Bare With such fury that it left the man and persued
Her a few steps in Which time the man got up
and Run a few steps but Was overtaken by the bare
When the Conl maid a second atempt to shoot but
His [gun] mised fyer again and the Slut as before
Releved the man Who Run as before—but Was Son
again in the grasp of the Bare Who Semed Intent
on His distruction—the Conl again Run Close up and
as before His gun Wold not go off the Slut makeing
an other atack and Releveing the man—the Conl now
be Came alarmed lest the Bare Wold pusue Him and
Run up Stooping tree—and after Him the Wounded
man and Was followed by the Bare and thus the Ware
all three up one tree—but a tree standing in Rich
[reach] the Conl steped on that and let the man and
Bare pas till the Bare Caught Him [Dawson] by one
leg and drew Him back wards down the tree.
While this Was doing the Conl Sharpened His flint
Primed His gun and Shot the Bare down While pulling
the man by the leg be fore any of the party arived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to Releve Him—but the Bare Soon Rose again but
Was Shot by several other [men] Wo Head [who
had] got up to the place of action—it Is to be Remarked
that the other three men With Him Run off—and
the Brush Was so thick that those on the out
Side Ware Som time geting threw—</p>

<p>I Was my Self down the Crick below the brush and
Heard the dredfull Screems of man in the Clutches
of the Bare—the yelping of the Slut and the Hollowing
of the men to Run in Run in the man Will be
killed and noing the distance So grate that I Cold not
get there in time to Save the man So that it Is much
Easeer to Emagen my feellings than discribe them but
before I got to the place of action the Bare Was
killed and [I] met the Wounded man with Robert
Fowler and one or two more asisting Him to Camp
Where His Wounds Ware Examined—it appeers His
Head Was In the Bares mouth at least twice—and
that When the monster give the Crush that Was to
mash the mans Head it being two large for the Span
of His mouth the Head Sliped out only the teeth
Cutting the Skin to the bone Where Ever the tuched
it—so that the Skin of the Head Was Cut from about
the Ears to the top in Several derections—all of
Which Wounds Ware Sewed up as Well as Cold be
don by men In our Situation Haveing no Surgen nor
Surgical Instruments—the man Still Retained His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
under Standing but Said I am killed that I Heard my
Skull Brake—but We Ware Willing to beleve He
Was mistaken—as He Spoke Chearfully on the Subgect
till In the after noon of the second day When He
began to be Restless and Some What delereous—and
on examening a Hole in the upper part of His Wright
temple Which We beleved only Skin deep We found
the Brains Workeing out—We then Soposed that He
did Heare His Scull Brake He lived till a little before
day on the third day after being Wounded—all
Which time We lay at Camp and Buried Him as Well
as our meens Wold admit Emedetely after the fattal
axcident and Haveing done all We Cold for the
Wounded man We turned our atention [to] the
Bare and found Him a large fatt anemel We Skined
Him but found the Smell of a polcat so Strong that
We Cold not Eat the meat—on examening His
mouth We found that three of His teeth Ware broken
off near the gums Which We Sopose Was the Caus
of His not killing the man at the first Bite—and the
one not Broke to be the Caus of the Hole in the
Right [temple] Which killed the man at last—the
Hunters killed two deer Cased the Skins for Baggs
We dryed out the Bares oil and Caryed it with us the
Skin Was all so taken Care of—</p>

moveing to us and by night from two to three Hunderd
lodges Ware Round us as Close as the Cold Set
up their lodges Which Seemed to afford ample protection
from the others</p>

the Ietan Cheef the first time He Came near us Since
We moved He Was very frendly and Efected to

pursons of all Sises—Some Horses Have been Stollen
Every night Since We arived amongst them Seven

Hunderd and fifty men Went In pursute of the theefs

<p class="noindent">I never parted with a man who showed as much sorrow
as the chief of the arrapoho He persuaded us very
much to stay with him one moon longer—stating to
us the danger of having our horses stolen &amp;c &amp;c but
finding in the morning we determined to start he
made no objection, after giving him a medal &amp;c as
I did to the other Chiefs—and making a small present
with all of which he was much satisfied when I shook
hands with him to start he threw himself on his bed
in tears—after traveling about one mile we was overtaken
by one of his brothers, a young chief with a request
to incamp on this side as his brother was starting
to follow so as to sleep one more night with us we
are truly fortunate in having those 3 nations with us—</p>

<h3 class="left">29th Decr</h3>

<p>The chief did not arrive last night as he sent us
word—but early next morning an express arrived to
inform us that instant as he was starting Two spaniards
arrived and that a party of 60 were expected to-day
with a request for us to return and see them—Mr
Roy &amp; myself immediatly returned, and recᵈ with
as much Joy and satisfaction by the village as if
though we had been absent for one year the friendship
which they shew us before the spaniards will convince
them that shoᵈ the party expected be hostile we
will have the friendship of the Indians and although
my party is now only 13 men in all I fele no fear in
meeting 60 Spaniards, with the multitude of the
Indians.</p>

<p class="noindent">Yesterday at about 3 Oclock we went out to the
Prarie to see if we could discover the spanish party—we
discovered them about 5 miles distance, we advanced
to meet them—when they discovered us they
halted and formed to receive us in “military style”—we
were requested by our Companion to Halt, when
we were received on a full charge—To within ten
paces of us when the men all dismounted and embraced
us with affection and friendship—they are all
creoles of that country—seem well disposed—possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
far less sence than the Indeans we are with, seem
happy and possess a greater degree of Joy at seeing
us than could be Immagined—It is a matter of astonishment
the difference of treatment of the Indians to
them and our party—the Indians Commanded them
as much as we command our negroes—At night the
Indians asked us if we were willing to let the Capt.
and his principle man sleep [in] the lodge with us,
which we agreed to—the Indeans derected them to
pray so that we may see their fashion which they
readily agreed to and went through with the Catholic
prayers, and afterwards prayed fervently for us—their
whole trading equipment in the U. S. would not sell
for fifty dollars—In short to describe them would require
the pen of a Butler and the pencil of a Hogarth—They
leave here to morrow for home and I intend
to accompany them—</p>

<h3 class="inline">31st Decr.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is only necessary to Judge of them to
say the Capt. and all his party were painted like the
Indians the day they traded—and during the prayer
the Capt. Caught a louse on his shirt and eat it—<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

twelve miles to the point of a mountain Cut off by the
River forming a parpendickelor Bluff of about fifteen
Hunderd feet High—over this mountain We Head

Broken and not quite so High as Wheare We Stayed

<p class="noindent">found one Bever in a trap this morning Sott the two
traps again and moved up the River about Six miles
and Ca[m]ped on the margen of the River the Rocks
not So High as last night but So Steep that We Cold
not git Watter from the River and melted Snow for
that Purpose Which We found among Some Rocks
We found some dry Ceders for fier Wood—6 miles</p>

dashing from one Rock over others In almost
one Continued foam the Hole distance threw the
mountains Which from What I Can larn is about
seventy miles When it appeers below In an
oppen Cuntry—I Have no doubt but the River
from the Head of those Rocks up for about
one Hundred miles Has once been a lake of about
from forty to fifty miles Wide and about two Hunderd
feet deep—and that the running and dashing of
the Watter Has Woren a Way the Rocks So as to
form the present Chanel—We this day Crosed a dry
Branch. But Have not Seen one Streem of Watter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>

the original military post, in Sebastian Co., Ark., about 5 m. S.
W. of Van Buren, on the right bank of the Arkansaw river, at the
mouth of Poteau river, immediately on the W. border of the
State, where the river passes from the Indian Territory into
Arkansas; lat. 35° 22´ N., long. 94° 28´ W.; pop. in 1890, 11,311.
The original name of the then important frontier locality was
Belle Pointe. “The site of Fort Smith was selected by
Major Long, in the fall of 1817, and called Belle Point in allusion
to its peculiar beauty. It occupies an elevated point of land,
immediately below the junction of the Arkansa and the Poteau,
a small tributary from the southwest. Agreeably to the orders
of General Smith, then commanding the 9th military department,
a plan of the proposed work was submitted to Major
Bradford, at that time, and since commandant at the post, under
whose superintendence the works have been in part completed”

Long’s Exp. 11, 1823, p. 171, with other remarks on p. 172: “5th

the Arkansa. We were hospitably received by the interpreter, a

<p>The most interesting of the above names is that of Nathaniel
Pryor, of whose identity with the sergeant of Lewis and Clark I
have no doubt: see L. and C., ed. of 1893, p. 254, delete the
query there, and add: Nathaniel Pryor of Kentucky became an
Ensign of the U. S. Army Feb 27, 1807, Second Lieutenant May
3, 1808, resigned April 1, 1810, was appointed First Lieutenant
of the 44th Inf. Aug 30, 1813, promoted to be Captain Oct 1,
1814, and honorably discharged June 15, 1815. See also my
article, “Letters of William Clark and Nathaniel Pryor,” in
Annals of Iowa, 3d ser., Vol I, No. 8, Jan., 1895, pp. 613-620, for
an account of Ensign Pryor’s disastrous attempt to convey the
Mandan chief Shahaka from St. Louis, Mo., to the Mandan villages
on the Missouri.</p>

road taken is marked on several maps I have examined. For
the Osage village in mention, see Pike, ed. of 1893, p. 557. This
“Arkansaw band” of Osages consisted of those called “Osages
of the Oaks,” in Long, ii, p. 251. Their most influential man
then, as in Pike’s time, was Clermont, surnamed the “Builder of
Towns,” and I suppose that the village now called Claremore,
among the Blue Mounds on the Verdigris, in the Cherokee
country, was named for him. In 1820 some of Long’s party
were assured “that Clermont had then four wives, and thirty-seven
children! a number ... which may probably be attributed
to this chief by mistake,” as the narrative sagely adds.
Clermont’s band are also called “Chaneers,” <i>ibid.</i>, p. 244, on the
authority of Dr. Sibley.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> These are the Blue Mounds mentioned in the last note. The

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The Verdigris has been crossed from E. to W. a very few
miles above the confluence therewith of the Little Verdigris or
Caney river, which is now on Fowler’s left as he follows it up
approximately, but at some distance therefrom, on a general
course about N. W. Of the series of its small tributaries, running
to his left, the one on which he camps is perhaps Five Mile
creek, or the next beyond that.</p>

up the Little Verdigris.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Some obscure tributary of the Little Verdigris, up which
river Fowler has come to a point probably not determinable from
his itinerary. On crossing the meridian of 96° W. he passed from
the Indian Territory into Oklahoma, and is now in the N. W.
corner of the latter, in the Osage Reservation, not far from the
S. border of Kansas. Hence he will take a general westerly
course, through the Osage country, nearly parallel with the
Kansas border and Cherokee strip, to the Arkansaw river. I
find myself unable to trace this traverse satisfactorily, as neither
the courses nor the distances given can be relied upon. I am
inclined to think Fowler sometimes reverses the courses of
streams—<i>i.e.</i>, gives them as they bear from himself, not as they
flow. At any rate I cannot identify the several streams he mentions
Oct. 3-5. I suppose that, after finishing with the watershed
of the Little Verdigris, he crosses some heads of Buck
(formerly Suicide) creek, and then Beaver and Little Beaver
creeks, whose united streams enter the Arkansaw at the Kaw
Agency.</p>

Fowler must cross these to strike the Arkansaw at the only point

be camped on Little Beaver creek, above its junction with
Beaver creek; if so, he is in the Kansas Indian Reservation, a

approaching the Arkansaw. Fowler says that he struck it on its

after crossing it, he ascended it for 8 m., he proceeded about
N. W. in the direction of Winfield.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> A mistake—Fowler has not yet reached the Pawnee fork of
the Arkansaw. His “paney River” is Walnut creek, near which
is Great Bend, seat of Barton Co. This identification is proven
by: (1) The <em>west</em> course assigned for to-day, the reach from
Ellinwood to Great Bend being the only one in that direction.
(2) The <em>walnut</em> and other trees named as growing on this stream.
(3) The statement that this is the <em>second</em> stream crossed since
leaving the Little Arkansaw—the only other one being Cow
creek of p. 19. (4) The courses and distances given beyond for
the identifiable streams crossed, namely: Pawnee fork, Coon
creek, and Mulberry creek, all of which fetch out quite right, if
the present adjustment be made, otherwise all wrong. It would
be curious to know if this is simply a blunder of Fowler’s, or if
Walnut creek was once known as “paney river”; most likely the
former, as I have never met with the present malidentification
before. See Pike, ed. of 1895, p. 425.</p>

<p>Fowler rounds the great bend, past Great Bend, and camps, as
he says, 9 m. short of the true Pawnee fork. It will be observed
that he has no name but “Red Rock” for the subsequently and
long famous Pawnee Rock, which now gives name to a station
on the railroad, said to be 16 m. above Great Bend and 13 m.
below Larned. It is said to have received its name from a fight
there in May or June, 1826, when an expedition which Col. Ceran
St. Vrain had fitted out was attacked by Pawnees, and Kit Carson,
then a boy, killed his own mule by mistake for an Indian during
a false alarm the night before. “Pawnee Rock is no longer conspicuous.
Its material has been torn away both by the railroad
and the settlers in the vicinity, to build foundations for water-tanks,
in the one instance, and for the construction of their
houses, barns, and sheds, in the other. Nothing remains of the
once famous landmark, its site is occupied as a cattle corral by
the owner of the claim in which it is situated,” says Inman, Old
Santa Fé Trail, 1897, pp. 404, 405.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Chouteau’s, whose name was long borne by a large island in
this vicinity, not easy to locate exactly. If there has been but one
of this name, Chouteau’s island has floated a good many miles up
and down the river—at least, in books I have sought on the subject.
Inman locates it near Cimarron, Kas., p. 42; at the mouth
of Big Sandy creek, Col., p. 75; and his map agrees with the
latter position. He says, pp. 40, 41: “As early as 1815, Auguste
P. Chouteau and his partner, with a large number of trappers
and hunters, went out to the valley of the upper Arkansas, ...
The island on which Chouteau established his trading-post, and
which bears his name even to this day, is in the Arkansas River
on the boundary line of the United States and Mexico....
While occupying the island, Chouteau and his old hunters were
attacked by about three hundred Pawnees, whom they repulsed
with the loss of thirty killed and wounded.” (Auguste P. Chouteau,
b. May 9, 1786, married Sophie A. Labadie Feb. 15, 1809;
d. 1839. He was the eldest son of John Pierre Chouteau, and
elder brother of Pierre Chouteau, jr., b. Jan. 19, 1789, d. Oct. 6,

This is the place where, on the 15th of Nov., 1806, Pike’s party
gave “three cheers to the Mexican mountains.” His map bears
the legend: “Here the Mountains are first seen.” It is a curious
fact, now forgotten by most persons, that the Spanish Peaks
were called and supposed to be Pike’s Peak for some time—during
the years that Pike’s Peak was called James’ Peak. Thus,
Thomas J. Farnham, writing of 1839 in his Travels, New York,
1843, p. 41, says: “Pike’s peak in the <em>south</em>west, and James’ peak
in the northwest, at sunset showed their hoary heads above the
clouds that hung around them.” Again, <i>ibid.</i>, p. 42: “Sixty miles
east of these mountains [in Colorado and New Mexico], and 50
<em>south</em> of the Arkansas, stands, isolated on the plain, Pike’s peak,
and the lesser ones that cluster around it”—here also thus distinguishing
it from James’ Peak, north of the Arkansaw. As I
have said in my edition of Pike, p. 457, where I discuss the first
application of Pike’s name to the peak which now bears it, the
date has never been exactly ascertained; and here in Farnham
we have the Spanish Peaks called by Pike’s name so late as 1839.
I suppose it will be difficult, if not impossible, to trace the proper
appellation of Pike’s Peak back of Frémont’s expedition of 1843-44.
At the time I penned my note on the subject I did not
know that the misapplication of Pike’s name to the Spanish
Peaks had ever been current, and my reference to the verbal use
of the term in the 30’s may have had no other foundation. Pike’s
Peak having been first surmounted by Dr. Edwin James and his
men, at 4 p. m., July 14, 1820, was formally named James’ Peak
in Long, ii, 1823, p. 45, from Long’s MS. notes of July 15, 1820.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Fowler’s supposition is correct—this is Pike’s “1st Fork” of
the Arkansaw, Spanish Rio Purgatorio and Rio de las Animas
Perdidas, French Rivière Purgatoire, English Purgatory river,
often corrupted into Picket-wire, and also known as Las Animas
river. It enters the Arkansaw from the S. in long. 103°
10´ W., midway between Fort Lyon (across the main stream) and
the town of Las Animas, Bent Co. See Pike, ed. of 1895, p. 445.</p>

Two Sisters; and when I was in that country I sometimes
heard the French names Les Tetons and Les Mamelles.

from personal observation of Taos, whither Fowler is bound.
He is well worth looking up in the present connection.</p>

and Otero counties, and near the site of Bent’s fort, which was a
noted place for many years. See Pike, ed. of 1895, pp. 446, 447,
and to authorities there cited for description add Farnham,
Travels, 1843, chap. iv, beginning p. 34. Fort William was an
alternative name of the same establishment—so called after one
of the Canadian-French Bent brothers, who were William,
George, Robert, and Charles. In 1826 three of them, with Ceran
St. Vrain, built a rude stockade on the N. bank of the Arkansaw
<em>above</em> Pueblo—perhaps halfway up to Cañon City. In 1828
they moved down below Pueblo, and began the erection of the
permanent structure called Fort William, which was long better
known as Bent’s “old” Fort. It existed till 1852, when Col.
Wm. Bent destroyed it with fire and gunpowder. He immediately
selected a new site lower down the Arkansaw, on the same
(N.) side, in the well-known locality of the Big Timbers, where
he erected Bent’s “new” fort in 1853, and used it as a trading-post
till 1859, when it was leased to the Government; Col. Bent
moving to a point just above Purgatory river for the winter of
1859-60. Next spring Bent’s place became Fort Wise, so named
for the Governor of Virginia, but in 1861 this name was changed
to Fort Lyon, in honor of Gen. Nathaniel Lyon, who was killed at
the battle of Wilson’s creek, Mo., Aug. 10, 1861. In the spring of
1866 the river undermined this post, and it was moved to a point
20 m. lower down, though the old post continued to be used as a
stage station by Barlow, Sanderson and Co.</p>

<p>We must pause here to consider Fowler as the first settler, or
at least squatter, on the site of the future Pueblo, Col., the honor
of founding which is claimed by, and commonly conceded to,
James P. Beckwourth, whose mendacity was as illimitable as the
plains over which he roamed while he was the great chief of the
Crows, and whose credit for the same was as high as the mountains
in which his adopted nation lurked. It is true that Pike
built at Pueblo a sort of stockade for the defense of his party,
but this was merely a log pen or breastwork which his men occupied
Nov. 24-29, 1806, while he went on a side trip to his peak.
The structure was such as could be thrown up over night, and all
trace of it speedily disappeared. But Fowler built a habitable
house and horse-corral, which he occupied about a month, while
his party were trapping, hunting, and herding their stock in the
vicinity, awaiting the appointed time to take up the Taos Trail
which Col. Glenn had already followed to Santa Fé. The site of
Pueblo does not appear to have been reoccupied in any way
that can be called settling, for 20 years after Fowler. Then the
redoubtable Jim appears upon the scene: see Leland’s ed. of
Bonner’s Life of Beckwourth, 1892, p. 383. “We reached the
Arkansaw about the first of October, 1842, where I erected a
trading-post, and opened a successful business. In a very short
time I was joined by from fifteen to twenty free trappers, with
their families. We all united our labors, and constructed an
adobe fort sixty yards square. By the following spring we had
grown into quite a little settlement, and we gave it the name of
Pueblo.” In so saying, this boundless liar tells the truth—whether
by accident or design is immaterial to the substantial accuracy
of what he says. We also read further in Inman, p. 252: “The
old Pueblo fort, as nearly as can be determined now, was built
as early as 1840, or not later than 1842, and, as one authority
asserts, by George Simpson and his associates, Barclay and
Doyle. Beckwourth claims to have been the original projector of
the fort, and to have given the general plan and its name, in
which I am inclined to believe he is correct; perhaps Barclay,
Doyle, and Simpson were connected with him, as he states that
there were other trappers, though he mentions no names. It
was a square fort of adobe, with circular bastions at the corners,
no part of the walls being more than eight feet high. Around
the inside of the plaza, or corral, were half a dozen small rooms
inhabited by as many Indian traders and mountain-men.”
According to Fitzpatrick, in 1847 the settlement contained about
150 men and 60 or more women, the former mostly Missourians,
French-Canadians, and Mexicans, whose wives were squaws of
various Indian tribes, together with some American Mormon
women. On this subject see also Pike, ed. of 1895, pp. 453, 454,
where an adobe fort is noted.</p>

from his description in the above interesting passage, that he is

<p>In Gregg’s Comm. of the Pra., i, 1844, p. 19 and p. 67 (quoted
in Pike, ed. of 1895, p. 437), it is stated that a party of about a
dozen men, including two named Beard and Chambers, reached
Santa Fé in 1812, and returned to the U. S. in 1822. In Inman’s
Santa Fé Trail, p. 41, it is made eight years after James Pursley’s
trip that “Messrs. <em>McKnight</em>, Beard, and Chambers, with
about a dozen comrades, started with a supply of goods across
the unknown plains, and by good luck arrived safely at Santa
Fé,” where their troubles began; their wares were confiscated,
and most of them were incarcerated at Chihuahua “for almost a
decade.” Inman agrees with Gregg that Beard and Chambers
reached St. Louis in 1822, and notes that “McKnight was murdered
south of the Arkansas by the Comanches in the winter of
1822,” meaning of 1822-23. This McKnight is obviously the man
whom Fowler names.</p>

on such a course, as the river is running due S. along here, after
coming E. from the mountains. Fowler was camped last night
at some uncertain point on the Canadian and on the present railroad
line, which runs due N. through Raton pass, across the
boundary between New Mexico and Colorado at 37°, and past
Fisher’s peak to Trinidad, on Purgatory river. But Fowler
makes altogether too much easting for any such course as this.
I understand, after careful consideration of his meager indications,
that his “up the crick” so many miles means up the Canadian
to the mouth of Chico Rico creek, a branch from the N. E.
which, if followed up, would take him through Manco Burro
Pass, between the Raton Mesa and the Chico Rico Mesa, to a
tributary of Purgatory river; but that, having gone up Chico
Rico creek to the confluence of its Una de Gato branch, he follows
up the latter to camp at the foot of the Chico Rico Mesa.
In no other way can we follow him “up a crick” continuously in
anything like the direction or to anything like the distance he
gives; and that this was the way he went will presently appear.</p>

N. from Chico Rico Mesa. Crossing this mesa in the direction
said, Fowler passes at 37° the line between New Mexico and
Colorado at the same place that the Denver, Texas, and Ft.
Worth R. R. does now—about long. 103° 53´ W.—and comes
down off the mesa about 5 m. due E. of Watervale, Las Animas
Co., Col. He keeps down the creek some 10 m. and camps on it,
about opposite the westernmost point of the Mesa de Maya.</p>

<p>From this point Fowler makes a break, almost as straight as
the crow flies, for the Arkansaw, which he will strike at Coolidge,
Kas. It is a long distance across country, about N. E., with no
exactly identifiable landmark till we stand him on Two Buttes;
and his trail does not coincide, except approximately, with any
road I can find laid down on the best modern maps. The nearest I
know of is what is called the “probable course” of the wagon road
from Cimarron to Granada, on the drainage sheet of Hayden’s
Atlas of Colorado, 1877; but the maps I go by are the later ones
of the U. S. Geological Survey, 2 m. to the inch. It is a matter
of special interest to recover this old trail as closely as possible.</p>

the trail pretty closely. The “mountain to our right” is the
general elevation of the Mesa de Maya, along which Fowler
passes about E. N. E., crossing successive dry drains of tributaries
of Purgatory river, all running to his left. Rounding the
extreme W. point of the Mesa said, Fowler steers past “a small
mountain standing by itself,” which appears to be, by a singular
coincidence, an isolated part of the general elevation now known
as <em>Fowler</em> Mesa. Further on E. along the N. border of the
Maya Mesa, is the better-known Mt. Carrizo, capped by Potatoe
Butte; the line between Las Animas and Baca counties cuts this
isolated elevation about lat. 37° 10´ N., and long. 103° 05´ W.

<p>Fowler has left the Arkansaw and taken up a devious ’cross
country route, which is to bring him through Kansas into Missouri
near Kansas City and so on through Independence, Mo., to Fort
Osage, on the Missouri river. In 1822 the road which soon became
the long famous Santa Fé caravan route from Independence
to the great bend of the Arkansaw was hardly established.
This went through Council Grove, by the most direct way which
the traders found it convenient to take. For an examination of
this route see Pike, ed. of 1895, pp. 517-522. It is interesting to
note, as showing that no such route as this had become established
and well known when Fowler went through, that he deviates
widely from what would have been his most direct and
in every way most eligible line of march. As we recover his
trail we shall find it to be one now unknown, looping far to the
S. into Butler Co., then passing heads of the Verdigris, crossing
the Neosho below the mouth of the Cottonwood, and so on eastward
with the requisite northing. I regard the trail we now
take up as something of an unexpected discovery.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_153" id="Footnote_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_153"><span class="label">[153]</span></a> From any position in which last night’s camp can have been,
it is impossible to bring Fowler to the Little Arkansaw on any
such course as <em>N.</em> 60° E. 30 miles. That course and distance
would take him far beyond the Little Arkansaw, to some point
about the heads of Turkey cr., N. of McPherson. Moreover, he
would never have seen the other party making down the
Arkansaw. Once more, the change I have made in reading the
text is required by what follows. He can be brought in “30”
miles <em>S.</em> 60° E. to the Little Arkansaw somewhere about the
mouth of Turkey creek, in Harvey Co. Observe that to-morrow’s
course, S. 65° E., is practically in the same direction he travels
to-day.</p>

same name which joins the Arkansaw near Great Bend. This
Walnut creek falls into the Arkansaw near the border of
Oklahoma, being the one called White river by Fowler on
Oct. 9 (p. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>), one of whose branches is still known as Whitewater.
Camp is on one of these, near the boundary between
Harvey and Butler counties. We now realize what a roundabout
route Fowler is taking from the great bend of the Arkansaw
to Fort Osage on the Missouri, being far S. of the regular
“Santa Fé Trail” that was soon to become established.</p>

south fork of the Cottonwood, which he mistakes for those of
the Verdigris. No head of the Verdigris flows anything like
west, as he says that branch does on which he camps. All his
indications set camp unmistakably at or near Thurman, Chase
Co., on that branch of Thurman creek which runs westerly.
This creek is joined at Matfield Green by two others, the three
together composing the south fork of the Cottonwood, running
N. This is a queer place to find a man on his way from Great
Bend to Kansas City—but here he is!</p>

the border of Osage Co.; whence Fowler proceeds about E. N. E.

size of the Marais des Cygnes itself, separated from the latter
by Salt creek—all three of these coming together within a mile
or two of each other, in the immediate vicinity of Quenemo,
Osage Co., close to the border of Franklin Co. For Dragoon cr.,
see Pike, ed. of 1895, p. 520. Fowler is now nearing what was
soon to become the regular Santa Fé caravan route from Independence,
Mo., to the great bend of the Arkansaw—after having
needlessly made a great bend of his own southward from that
direct line of travel.</p>

<p>“In 1812 a Captain Becknell, who had been on a trading expedition
to the country of the Comanches in the summer of 1811,
and had done remarkably well, determined the next season to
change his objective point to Santa Fé,” says Inman, p. 38.
When at or near the Caches on the Arkansaw, he left that stream
and took his party across country on the Cimarron or dry route;
but they were obliged to return, after suffering horribly from
thirst, and follow up the Arkansaw route to Taos.</p>

<p>“The virtual commencement of the Santa Fé trade dates from
1822”; and in 1824 was made the first attempt to introduce
wagons, etc., says Inman, p. 51. According to Gregg, a better
authority, both pack animals and wagons were used 1822-25, but
after that wagons only. According to Fowler’s passage above,
we see that Becknell had taken wagons in 1822 if not earlier;
and thus the party to which Col. Marmaduke was attached, and
which reached Santa Fé with wagons in 1824, was not the first
to pass through Kansas on wheels.</p>

Ottawa. As “all the Watters runs South East,” we know that
Fowler is still on the Osage watershed, and I am inclined to set
his camp on one of the heads of Ottawa creek, some 6 m. W. of
Baldwin City, Douglas Co., perhaps not far from Willow Springs
camp of the traders; for which see Pike, ed. of 1895, p. 519.</p>

<h2>DR. COUES’ WORKS ON WESTERN EXPLORATION.</h2>

<p class="noindent">To the Headwaters of the Mississippi River, the Interior Parts of Louisiana,
Mexico and Texas, in the years of 1805-6-7. Reprinted in full from the original
Philadelphia edition of 1810. With copious explanatory, geographical and scientific
notes to the text, a new Memoir of Pike and an Index to the whole.
By Prof. Elliott Coues, Edition limited, 3 vols., 8vo.</p>

<p>This edition of Pike’s explorations is only
second in value to the annotated journals of Lewis
&amp; Clark, by the same editor. The rearrangement
by Dr. Coues of the appendices and other extraneous
matter adds very greatly to its value, since in
the original edition even the experienced reader
has found it difficult to collate complete information
on many important topics. The volumes are
an important contribution to geographical and
historical literature.—<i>The Nation</i> (3 columns).</p>

<p>On the whole, the new Pike must prove monumental.
It will forever link its author with Pike’s
fame. Its map of Mississippi sources, and the
arduous voyage (of the editor) into the farthest
fountains, will not let us wonder that the Minnesota
Park Commissioner styled a lakelet feeding
Itasca, Elliot Coues, and inscribed that name
upon a boulder on that utmost shore.—<i>American
Historical Review</i> (2½ pages).</p>

<p>The great merit in Dr. Coues’ notes is that they
preserve the history of the localities and give
credit to all the local historians and archæologists.
Dr. Coues seems to have read all of the local histories
and records, whether contained in books,
pamphlets or even newspapers, and has given the
references with great painstaking. In fact, the
notes are equivalent to a bibliography.—<i>American
Antiquarian and Oriental Journal.</i></p>

<p>Dr. Coues’ new edition of “Pike’s Expeditions”
is a beautiful specimen of presswork most creditable
to the taste and liberality of the publisher.
The editor has done the material portion of his
work as successfully as has the publisher, the result
is a well-digested and most readable chronicle, instead
of ill-assorted bundles of information (as in the
original edition). No explorer has ever been more
fully aided to express himself through the ampler
knowledges of the generations that come after him
than in this case.—<i>The Dial</i> (2½ pages).</p>

<p>Dr. Coues says of this work: “No work approaching
these journals in the scope, extent,
variety and interest of its contents has appeared
since the publication in 1801 of Sir Alexander
Mackenzie’s memorable voyages, and the present
work will undoubtedly take rank with that classic
as a veritable mine of accurate information.”

<p>“The exceeding value of the work lies in the fact
that it is new. Not for a long time has a book of
such great historical interest been published in
this country ... it should become a cherished
book in the eyes of all those who take more than a
passing interest in the early history of our
country.”—<i>New York Herald.</i></p>

<p>“The claim of the publisher that few such important
books as this have been issued recently, is
a just one. The work is all that could be desired
in every way.”—<i>Cincinnati Commercial-Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“He (Dr. Coues) beheld in Henry that which he
most desired to complete his magnificent endeavor
to illuminate the world of the West during the
early years of the nineteenth century.”—<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>“Dr. Coues’ study and research as shown in
these volumes is simply marvelous.”—<i>New York
Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“It will be seen also that Henry and Thompson
to a degree overlap Lewis and Clark.”—<i>The Dial.</i></p>

<p>“The study of the Indians was his (Henry’s) life
work. Here he is keenest and most valuable.”—<i>Baltimore
Sun.</i></p>
